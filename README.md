# Auto Route Finder

A VSCode extension that helps Flutter developers easily jump to the definition of classes generated by the AutoRoute package.

## Features

- **Automatic Route Detection**: Monitors Dart files for `*Route` class names (e.g., `HomeRoute`, `SettingsRoute`)
- **Inline CodeLens**: Displays "Jump to Definition" buttons above matched route classes
- **Smart Navigation**: Automatically finds and opens the corresponding widget file
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize routes file path and naming conventions
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes when routes.gr.dart file is saved

## How It Works

1. The extension scans your `routes.gr.dart` file to build a map of route definitions
2. When you open a Dart file containing `*Route` classes, it shows inline "Jump to Definition" buttons
3. Clicking a button opens the corresponding widget file and focuses on the class definition

## Requirements

- Flutter project with AutoRoute package
- Generated `routes.gr.dart` file (default location: `lib/routes.gr.dart`)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `autoRouteFinder.routesFilePath`: Path to the routes.gr.dart file relative to workspace root (default: `lib/routes.gr.dart`)
* `autoRouteFinder.replaceInRouteName`: Value for replaceInRouteName used in AutoRouterConfig (default: `Screen,Route`)

## Configuration

### Default Configuration

The extension works out of the box with the default AutoRoute setup:

```dart
@AutoRouterConfig(replaceInRouteName: 'Screen,Route')
class AppRouter extends _$AppRouter {
  // Your routes...
}
```

### Custom Configuration

If you use different settings, configure them in your workspace `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "autoRouteFinder.routesFilePath": "lib/generated/routes.gr.dart",
  "autoRouteFinder.replaceInRouteName": "Page,Route"
}
```

### Example Project Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ routes.gr.dart          # Generated routes file
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/               # Widget files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home_screen.dart   # Contains HomeScreen class
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings_screen.dart # Contains SettingsScreen class
â””â”€â”€ main.dart
```

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Open a Dart file containing route references (e.g., `HomeRoute`)
3. Look for the "ðŸ”— Jump to HomeScreen" button above the route class
4. Click the button to navigate to the corresponding widget file

## Supported Route Patterns

The extension recognizes these patterns in your `routes.gr.dart` file:

```dart
static const HomeRoute = AutoRoute<HomeScreen>(...);
static const SettingsRoute = AutoRoute<SettingsScreen>(...);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Routes Not Detected

1. Ensure your `routes.gr.dart` file exists at the configured path
2. Check that your AutoRoute configuration matches the `replaceInRouteName` setting
3. Verify that your widget files contain the expected class names

### Widget Files Not Found

The extension searches for widget files in these locations:
- `lib/screens/`
- `lib/pages/`
- `lib/views/`
- `lib/`
- `lib/src/screens/`
- `lib/src/pages/`
- `lib/src/views/`

Make sure your widget files are in one of these directories or adjust the search logic.

### Performance

- The extension caches route definitions and refreshes them when `routes.gr.dart` is saved
- Large projects with many routes may take a moment to load initially
